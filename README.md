# Say Thank You - A fun way to send thank you notes 🎉

We all have people in our lives who unconditionally support us all our life. Their importance is our life is inevitable and their presence in our life makes it all the more wonderful. Let us take some time out and pen an emotional note 💌 to our near and dear ones thanking them for all that they did for us, bring a smile to their faces and brighten ☀️ up their life.


### Ah, the nitty gritty of it!

Once you have composed ✍️ your wonderful heartfelt message, a special link along with a unique token would be generated. Share it with the person whom you want to send your thanks to. Add a dash of personal touch to it by setting up a witty question 😉 and an equally headscratching answer which you think only the intended recepient would be able to answer and make it more fun and exciting. 🎁


#### Here's what powers it...

**Angular** makes up the frontend and you can find it [here](https://github.com/rahul-kabra/say-thank-you). **SpringBoot** powers the backend application logic. **MySQL** stores all your emotional thank you notes in its vault. **Github** and **PCF** help us in serving this to you. There you go, all the magic out in the open. 🔮
